# awscloud-hpc
A set of tools to enable the provisioning of ready to use HPC clusters on Amazon Web Services.

For background on this work, please review the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG3SKaf7yEw

Link Digital (trading as Data Shades for international 'as a service' initiatives) has worked with the NCI (National Computational Infrastructure), and Amazon Web Services to deliver a proof of concept for Raijin in a box, funded by Intel.

Muhammad Atif, Manager of Cloud Systems at NCI and Shane Davis, AWS Solution Architect at Link Digital outline the approach taken and provide a working demonstration of the cluster automation and job processing.

Code and information within this repository will grow as the work is futher developed. 

Feedback and suport to advance the initiative is welcome.
